# Customer Segmentation Model

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that integrates directly with a database. The pipeline retrieves raw data, processes and encodes features, applies a trained model, and saves the predictions back into a separate table within the same database. The goal of this project is to operationalize machine learning so predictions can be generated automatically and consistently, supporting real-world decision-making.

## Features
Data Ingestion: Connects to a database and retrieves raw input data.

Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and applies necessary transformations.

Model Training & Loading: Supports training a machine learning model or loading a previously saved one.

Prediction: Generates predictions on unseen data with flexible threshold adjustment.

Class Imbalance Handling: Includes oversampling techniques to improve recall on minority classes.

Evaluation: Produces metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for performance monitoring.

Deployment Integration: Saves predictions back into the database in a dedicated table for downstream use.
